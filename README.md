## **System Processes**  

This section outlines key system workflows through **sequence diagrams**, illustrating user, system, and external component interactions. These processes are crucial for the platform's **core functionality**, ensuring seamless **authentication**, **communication**, and **user engagement**.

> For additional workflows and a complete set of sequence diagrams, refer to the **[full repository](https://github.com/StudentPortal-grad/student-portal-docs/tree/main/0x09-Sequence_Diagrams)**.

### **Start a Discussion Process**  

Starting a discussion enables **interactive communication** within a group, encouraging users to engage in academic or community-related topics. This workflow validates the title and content before storing the discussion, ensuring only well-formed and relevant content is uploaded.  

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Discussion
    participant DB

    User->>Discussion: Clicks "Start Discussion"
    User->>Discussion: Submits Title and Content
    Discussion->>DB: Validate Title and Content
    alt Validation Fails
        DB-->>Discussion: Validation Error
        Discussion-->>User: Show Validation Error
    else Validation Passes
        DB-->>Discussion: Validation Successful
        Discussion->>DB: Insert Discussion into `discussions` Table
        DB-->>Discussion: Discussion Stored
        Discussion-->>User: Show Success Message
    end
```

---

### **Upload Academic Materials Process**  

This process is key for ensuring that **academic resources** are uploaded, categorized, and stored correctly for user access. It includes validation checks to confirm that the uploaded files meet the necessary requirements, including file type and metadata, ensuring smooth integration into the system.  


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Resource
    participant DB

    User->>Resource: Clicks "Upload Resource"
    User->>Resource: Submits File, Title, and Description
    Resource->>DB: Validate File Type and Metadata
    
    alt Validation Fails
        DB-->>Resource: Validation Error
        Resource-->>User: Show Validation Error
    else Validation Passes
        DB-->>Resource: Validation Successful
        Resource->>DB: Insert File Metadata into `resources` Table
        DB-->>Resource: File Metadata Saved
        Resource-->>User: Show "Upload Successful" Message
    end
```

---

### **Create Event Process**  

The process is essential for organizing academic and community-related events in the system. Faculty members or administrators can submit event details, which are validated to ensure all required fields are filled in correctly. If successful, the event is stored in the system and confirmed to the user.  

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FacultyOrAdmin as FacultyOrAdmin
    participant Event as Event
    participant DB as DB

    FacultyOrAdmin->>Event: Clicks "Create Event"
    FacultyOrAdmin->>Event: Submits Event Details
    Event->>DB: Validate Event Fields

    alt Validation Fails
        DB-->>Event: Validation Error
        Event-->>FacultyOrAdmin: Show Validation Error
    else Validation Passes
        DB-->>Event: Validation Successful
        Event->>DB: Insert Event into `events` Table
        DB-->>Event: Event Stored
        Event-->>FacultyOrAdmin: Show Success Message
    end
```
