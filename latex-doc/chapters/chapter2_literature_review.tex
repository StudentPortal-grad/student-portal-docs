    \item \textbf{Centralized Notifications \& Dashboard:} A single hub for announcements, reducing communication delays.
    \item \textbf{Seamless Community Collaboration:} Interactive discussion forums and categorized knowledge-sharing spaces.
    \item \textbf{Student Affairs Integration:} Direct integration with academic administration for instant updates.
\end{enumerate}
